This is the front end with a React framework and Axios as the HTTP client.

## Instructions

By now, you should have created a Smartcar account and have obtained the `client-id` and `secret`.

Set these environment variables:
```bash
$ export REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID=<your-client-id>
$ export REACT_APP_REDIRECT_URI=https://javascript-sdk.smartcar.com/v2/redirect?app_origin=http://localhost:3000
$ export REACT_APP_SERVER=http://localhost:8000
```
In production, replace the localhosts with the correct client and server urls.
